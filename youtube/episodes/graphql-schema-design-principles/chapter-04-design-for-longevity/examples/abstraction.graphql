  stripeCustomerId: String!         # Client now depends on Stripe
  stripePaymentMethodType: String!  # Switching providers = breaking change

# Good: Abstract behind your own types

# Now you can switch from Stripe to Adyen, Square, or anything else
# without touching your GraphQL schema or breaking clients.
