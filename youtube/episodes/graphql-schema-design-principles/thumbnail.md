# Thumbnail Concept

## Style
diagram-driven

## Visual description
Dark navy background. Left side: a messy, tangled schema graph in red/orange (representing bad design). Right side: a clean, organized schema graph in cyan/green (representing good design). An arrow points from left to right. The GraphQL logo sits subtly in the top-right corner.

## Text on thumbnail
SCHEMA DONE RIGHT

## Color palette
Dark navy background (#1a1a2e) + orange-red for the "bad" side (#ff4444) + cyan for the "good" side (#00d4ff).

## Title options (pick best CTR)
1. 10 GraphQL Schema Design RULES You Need
2. GraphQL Schema Design: 10 Battle-Tested Rules
3. Stop Designing GraphQL Schemas Like This
4. GraphQL Schema Mistakes EVERYONE Makes
5. The RIGHT Way to Design GraphQL Schemas

## Title-thumbnail relationship
The thumbnail shows the visual transformation from messy to clean schema (the "what"), while the title promises the specific rules that get you there (the "how"). Together they create curiosity: "My schema looks like the left side — I need those rules."
