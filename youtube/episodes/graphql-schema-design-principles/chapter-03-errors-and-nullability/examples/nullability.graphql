# Three different nullability situations:

type User {
  id: ID!                    # Truly non-nullable: always exists
  name: String!              # Truly non-nullable: required at creation

  bio: String                # Intentionally nullable: user may not have set one

  email: String @semanticNonNull  # Should always exist, but if null = error occurred
  avatar: String @semanticNonNull # Should always exist, but if null = error occurred
}

# Without @semanticNonNull, clients can't tell the difference between:
#   bio: null    → "User hasn't written a bio"
#   email: null  → "Something broke in the email service"
#
# With @semanticNonNull, clients know:
#   If email is null, treat it as an error — don't show "no email set"
