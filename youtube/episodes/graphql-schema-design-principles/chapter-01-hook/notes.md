# Visual & Production Notes: Hook

## On-screen visuals (in order)
1. 0:00 — Animated diagram: database table structure morphing into a GraphQL schema (1:1 mapping, looks ugly and mechanical)
2. 0:10 — Diagram highlights problems: multiple queries needed, confusing type names
3. 0:18 — Cut to talking head, Jens speaking directly to camera
4. 0:30 — Company logos flash briefly: eBay, SoundCloud, Paramount, Shutterstock
5. 0:35 — Quick list animation: all 10 principle names appear stacked, then fade to blur
6. 0:42 — Back to talking head for the open loop about principle #6

## B-roll / inserts
- Database-to-schema auto-generation animation (stylized, not a real tool screenshot)
- Company logos appearing briefly as credibility markers

## Diagrams to create
- "Bad schema" diagram: database ER diagram on left, nearly identical GraphQL schema on right, connected by arrows showing 1:1 mapping
- Quick flash card of all 10 principle titles (used as a teaser, shown too fast to read fully)

## Code to show
- None in this chapter
