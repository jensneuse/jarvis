[VISUAL: All 10 principles listed on screen, organized into the three groups from the video]

[CUT TO: talking head]

Let's bring it all together. Ten principles, three big ideas.

[VISUAL: Group 1 highlighted — principles 1-3]

First: design for your clients, not your backend. Start with capabilities, structure around workflows, and don't be afraid to duplicate types when they serve different purposes.

[VISUAL: Group 2 highlighted — principles 4-6]

Second: be honest about failure. Use union types for expected errors. Understand nullability. And respect the null blast radius — your non-nullable fields are ticking time bombs if you're not careful.

[VISUAL: Group 3 highlighted — principles 7-10]

Third: design for the long game. Assume every field is permanent. Paginate everything. Abstract your implementation. And match your schema architecture to your team structure.

If you take one thing from this video, let it be this: your GraphQL schema is a product. Design it like you're building something your clients will use for years — because they will.

If you're working on a schema right now, I'd challenge you to pick the three principles you're violating the most and fix those first. Don't try to do all ten at once.

Drop a comment — which principle surprised you the most? I'm curious whether the nullability stuff or the organizational stuff resonates more with your experience.

If this was useful, smash the like button — it genuinely helps the algorithm surface this to other developers. And subscribe if you want more content like this. Next week I'm going deep on GraphQL Federation architecture — how to split your schema across teams without losing your mind.
